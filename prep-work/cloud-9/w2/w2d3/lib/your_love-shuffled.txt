I ain't got many friends left to talk to
Just 'cause you're right, that don't mean I'm wrong
You know I'd do anything for you
(Lose your love tonight)
No, no (Lose your love tonight)


I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna (Lose your love tonight)
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your love tonight
Try to stop my hands from shakin'
(Lose your love)
Josie's on a vacation far away
Come around and talk it over
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your love tonight, whoa
Somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense
No one's around when I'm in trouble
So many things that I want to say
I just wanna use your love tonight
Tonight (Lose your love)
I can't hide the way I'm feelin'
You know I like my girls a little bit older
(Lose your love tonight)

Yeah, I just wanna use your love tonight

As you leave me, please, would you close the door?
Another shoulder to cry upon
No, no (I don't wanna lose your love tonight)
And don't forget what I told you
I don't wanna lose (Lose your love tonight)
(Lose your love)
Stay the night but keep it undercover
I just wanna use your love tonight, yeah
It's been awhile since we were all alone
